	<p>Anna Karenina is set in a time that is the height of what is now called the Golden Age of Russian Literature. <br><br>Romanticism was at its peak, and the movement inspired all genres. <br><br>The movies based on this time have lush visuals and elegant characters. One can pause at any scene in Anna Karenina and it would look like a beautiful photograph. <br><br>If one loves period dramas, the way they dress and how everything is decorated in intricate ways, the movie Atonement will be a perfect fit to watch after Anna Karenina, especially because it is very influential in terms of style and psychological complexity as well. <br><br>Another movie would be Never Let Me Go, which also explores the inner ranges of human experience, trying to capture individual struggle. </p>
