		<p>This website covers the ins and outs of me geeking out about one of my favourite period dramas of all time - Anna Karenina!</p>

		<p>Anna Karenina, based on Tolstoy's novel, makes the audience relate to every single character at some point in their personal story, even to this date. That is pretty crazy.<br> <br>Russian high society in the late 1800s. It is like a detailed study of every possible human emotion. <br> <br>It connects with the viewers because of the flaws in the characters and their evolution over time because of the events surrounding their lives. <br> <br>One can relate to the contrasts: city/country, married/single, rich/poor or man/woman. <br> <br>It is noticeable how every character, even the ones who behaved poorly had some small redeeming quality. <br> <br>It's a black and white story of love and adultery but with so many nuances that one realizes how hard it can be to judge people's actions. <br> <br>Tolstoy was a genius, and so are the actors who portray the characters in the movie, especially Keira Knightley as the protagonist, Anna.
		<br> <br>How many novels have been written about adultery? How many that truly understand a woman's point of view? How many that sympathetically present a heroine succumbing to temptation, showing the dilemma women face(d)? <br> <br>Yes, Anna Karenina is long-winded. <br> <br>Yes, it seems like a soap opera at times. But remove the context, considering only what is now a fairly familiar story of love and betrayal, it is not easy to miss the point. Also, much of the pathos and prose is brilliant. <br> <br>It just gets deeper, better, richer.</p>
