	<h1>Audience</h1>
	<p>''Anna Karenina'' may be pretty to look at, but as the old saying goes, handsome is as handsome does. This movie has adult themes and mildly explicit love scenes. Anna Karenina is rated R for sexual scenes and violence. <br><br>I give this movie 4 stars out of 5 and recommend it to all lovers of history, art, and creation. This movie is perfect for the ones who enjoy seeing something different, with unique details, and elaborate outfits.</p>
