	<h1>Plot Summary</h1>
	<p>A crisis emerges in the Oblonsky family when Dolly finds out about her husband Stiva's infidelity. Stiva's sister, Anna Karenina, arrives to reunite the couple and disinclines Dolly from getting a divorce. Levin, Stiva's friend, arrives in Moscow to propose to the eighteen-year-old Kitty. She rejects him for Count Vronsky, a striking army officer. Meeting the captivating Anna, Vronsky begins to pursue her. He and Anna are so engaged with each other at the grand ball that Kitty's hopes for Vronsky are destroyed.
<br> <br>
Fulfilling her union with Vronsky, Anna steps into a different life with critical anticipation for the future. By the time she admits her adultery to the suspecting Karenin, she is already pregnant with Vronsky's child.
<br> <br>
Meanwhile, dedicating himself to farming, Levin tries to find meaning in life without marriage. Vronsky's professional aspirations rival his love, and as he has not chosen between them, he is still uncommitted to Anna. Having renounced her husband, but still incapable of depending on Vronsky, Anna finds her position hopeless. Her life is in a state of suspension.
<br> <br>
Kitty and Levin are engaged to marry. Karenin, who has tried to keep displays of domestic tranquillity, finally builds up enough rage to select a divorce lawyer. Anna is confined of a daughter, but dangerously ill from puerperal fever. On her deathbed, Karenin forgives her and feels blessed by this surge of humanity and Christian charity. At this sudden reversal of their roles, Vronsky feels so humiliated he attempts suicide. These incidents form the turning point of the novel. After Anna's recovery, the lovers go abroad and Anna refuses divorce (though Karenin agrees to it) for fear of giving up her son.
<br> <br>
Strongly affected from seeing her son again, Anna's love for Vronsky becomes more desperate now that she has no one else. Notwithstanding his objections, she boldly attends the theater as if to declare her love before traditional society. Embarrassed at the opera, she blames Vronsky for lacking compassion for her misery, while he is angry at her stupidity and feels burdened by her demands. 
<br> <br>
Kitty gives birth to a son. Karenin, under the influence of his fanatically devout friend, Lydia, becomes religious and uses his faith as a crutch to overcome his humiliation and loneliness.
<br> <br>
Anna, seeing the immutable decline of her love affair, has no more will to live and commits suicide. This is the climax of the movie.
<br> <br>
Vronsky aides for service in the Russo-Turkish war. The movie uses this to express his pacifist principles. Levin finds redemption when he decides to "live for his soul" rather than for self-seeking goals. He realizes the meaning of life consists in living according to the morality ingrained in every individual. Understanding death as part of a reality-oriented life, Levin is at peace with himself.
