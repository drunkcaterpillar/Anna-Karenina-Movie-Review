	<h1>Cultural Aspect</h1>
	<p>Anna Karenina sets the tale of adultery and self-discovery against the backdrop of the huge historical changes sweeping through Russia during the late nineteenth century, making the historical aspects of the novel just as important as the personal and psychological aspects. <br><br>In the Russia of Anna Karenina, a battle rages between the old patriarchal values and the new, liberal or freethinking values of the Westernizers. <br><br>We see this clash in Levin’s difficulty with his peasants, who, refusing to accept the Western agricultural innovations he tries to introduce, believe that the old Russian ways of farming are the best. <br><br>The guests at Stiva’s dinner party raise the question of women’s rights - clearly a hot topic of the day and always in the news today, and one that shows the influence of Western social progress on Russia. <br><br>That Dolly and Anna suffer in their marriages, however, does not bode well for the future of feminism in the world of the movie. <br><br>Courtship procedures are equally uncertain in the world of Anna Karenina. <br><br>Taken together, all this confusion created by fading traditions creates an atmosphere of both instability and new potential, as if humans have to decide again how to live. <br><br>It is only in such a changing cultural atmosphere that a lot of philosophical questioning is possible.</p>
