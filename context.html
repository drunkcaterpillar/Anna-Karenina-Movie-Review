	<h1>Context</h1>
	<p>There is a significant historical context of the movie. Liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia, especially the emancipation of the serfs, form the background of the political events surrounding the events of the storyline. <br><br>In nineteenth-century Russia, writers were promoting communal living and the emancipation of women as well. Russia was undergoing a societal transition from a primarily rural, agricultural economy to a more Westernized, urban, industrial society, and in many ways, Tolstoy was deeply suspicious of the changes. <br><br>This reflects in his novel and ultimately in the movie too.</p>
